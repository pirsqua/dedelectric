# Carnitas

## Ingredients
- 3-5 lbs boneless pork shoulder (or remove the bone)
- 3-5 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp CHINESE FIVE SPICE
- 1 1/2 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 2 bay leaves, torn in half
- 8 cloves garlic, sliced
- 1 orange, shave the peel in small pieces and add most of the juice
- 1/2 cup olive oil

## Instructions
1. Heat oven to 280 F.
2. Trim the pork shoulder, removing large pieces of fat and connective tissue, and cut the meat into roughly 2 inch cubes.
3. Combine everything, including fat scraps, into Dutch oven. Mix thoroughly. Add more olive oil so the meat is mostly submerged, but some sticking out. As all the fat renders, it should eventually be almost all covered.
4. Lower center rack in oven and add Dutch oven. Keep lid slightly ajar to brown the exposed meat. Roast for 4-6 hours, stirring after two hours and every hour after that.
5. Remove from oven when you can smoosh the meat with a fork. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the carnitas to a container. Then use a spoon to scoop up some oil and drizzle on top of the little meats.
6. When ready to eat, add to foil-lined baking sheet in 400 F oven and cover with foil. It will steam in like 10 minutes in there. Then turn the broiler to high, pull the foil off the top, put on top rack, and give a couple minutes to add some char. Check every minute so you don't burn it.
